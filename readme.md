# StackOverflow

Code and examples to go with my answers and questions on the stackoverflow website.

Currently I have several answers where I use code examples. In some cases a live 
version is profided using jsfiddle or ideone, etc, but I thought it might be a 
good idea to have all of this information together in one place as well.
